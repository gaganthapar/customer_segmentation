# customer_segmentation

n this workbook, I aim to perform customer segmentation using K means clustering.

Customer segmentation is a process used by companies to divide their customers into groups that reflect similarities among customers in each group. The goal of segmentation is to identify high-yield segments – that is, those segments most likely to be profitable or that have growth potential – so that these can be targeted more effectively with marketing strategies, products, and services tailored to their specific needs, behaviors, and preferences.

How Customer Segmentation Works Data Collection: Collecting data on various customer attributes, such as demographics (age, gender, income level, etc.), psychographics (lifestyle, values, attitudes), purchasing behavior (purchase history, product preferences, spending habits), and interactions with the brand (customer service interactions, feedback, channel preferences).

Data Analysis: Analyzing the collected data to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can help in understanding the different types of customers.

Segmentation: Dividing the customer base into distinct groups based on identified patterns and attributes. These groups should be homogenous within (similar to each other) and heterogeneous between (different from other groups).

Targeting and Positioning: Developing marketing strategies and product or service offerings that are tailored to the specific needs and preferences of each segment.

K-means clustering in customer segmentation

K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm that is particularly useful for customer segmentation. It helps in identifying underlying patterns in the data by grouping data points into a predefined number of clusters based on similarity. Here’s how it can help in customer segmentation:

Identifying Clusters: K-means clustering algorithm partitions the data into K clusters. It starts with initial guesses for the centers of the clusters, which can either be randomly selected or based on some heuristic. Then, it iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest cluster center based on some distance measure (usually Euclidean distance), and updates the center of each cluster until the assignment of data points to clusters no longer changes.

Optimal Segments: The algorithm helps in finding the most optimal segments (clusters) based on data attributes. Each cluster represents a segment of customers with similar characteristics.

Data-Driven Insights: By analyzing the characteristics of customers in each cluster, businesses can gain insights into customer preferences, behaviors, and needs, which might not be apparent without this segmentation.

Tailored Strategies: With clear segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, product development, and customer service approaches to meet the specific needs of each segment, potentially increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty, and optimizing resource allocation.

Scalability and Flexibility: K-means is scalable to large datasets and can accommodate different types of data attributes, making it versatile for various customer segmentation needs.

I got the data from Kaggle.
